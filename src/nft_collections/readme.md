# DIP-721 Canister Configuration

## Overview
The DIP-721 standard restricts us to one NFT collection per canister, presenting a challenge in efficient `dfx.json` setup to optimize IC mainnet resources.

## Unique Collection Strategies

### Beyond CRUD: Flexibility & Growth
Collections such as "playing_cards" and "dogesweeper" demand unique features beyond standard operations. So I'm allocating dedicated code to each. Now, NFTs transition from mere randomly generated artwork to entities with tangible use cases. For instance, owning a "playing_card 14/52" not only signifies possession but also grants the authority to authenticate and implement modifications to your 4 of hearts or something.

### Gimmicks with Purpose
It's a step a bit further from traditional uses, where the "gimmicks" we introduce carry real utility (depending what you call real), redefining what NFTs can be and do in windoge ecosystem.
in future games, users can send each other their weapons/tools/coins for example without being on the game and trading in-game items for example, imagine earning a skin for a weapon and the canister allowing it to be transferred into a NFT which you can sent to your friend who can then redeem it etc. the use case for it is that the user is in control of the data he has within the game for exmple
would also be a nice use case for minting and burning through a sns controlled custodian

## Centralized WASM for Thematic Collections

When it comes to thematic collections—be it meme-inspired visuals or vintage tech nostalgia—a unified WASM approach is the go-to. This strategy is resource-efficient and simplifies development, ideal for cases where thematic cohesion is paramount over functional variety.

- doge within a funny windows98 desktop-window collection
- old nostalgic computers collection
- cursor nft's, black cursor, red cursor, animated glitter cursor etc

for all of these artsy collections an centralized wasm is useful

## Conclusion // TL:DR
yes, its double to copy paste dip721 standard into two or more collections, but that allows them to evolve independently.
for the artsy stuff its 100% the go to, to use one dip721 and just reuse the wasm from it to build the canisters
