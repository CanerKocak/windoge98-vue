            A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital tool that allows users to
            store, manage, and transact with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin,
            Ethereum, ICP and others.
          </p>
          <p>
            It operates by interacting with various blockchain networks to
            enable the sending and receiving of cryptocurrency transactions and
            for checking the user's balance.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are several key aspects to understand about cryptocurrency
            wallets:
          </p>

          <strong>Key Aspects</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Types of Wallets</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Software Wallets: Applications for computers or mobile
                  devices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hardware Wallets: Physical devices storing cryptocurrency
                  offline.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Paper Wallets: Documents with cryptocurrency addresses and
                  private keys.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Security</strong>: Requires safekeeping of private
              keys/seed phrase and secure internet connections.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Multi-Currency vs. Single-Currency Wallets</strong>: Some
              support multiple types of cryptocurrencies, others only one.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User Control</strong>: Custodial (managed by a third
              party) and non-custodial (user-managed) wallets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Integration with Services</strong>: Many offer integrated
              services like exchanges for buying, selling, or trading.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Note: Cryptocurrency wallets do not store actual coins but provide
            tools to interact with blockchain networks. The balance is recorded
            on the blockchain, with the wallet offering a user interface for
            interaction.
